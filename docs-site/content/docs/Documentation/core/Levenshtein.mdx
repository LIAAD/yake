# Levenshtein

The `Levenshtein` class provides utilities for calculating edit distances and similarity ratios between strings using the Levenshtein algorithm.

## Class Overview

```python
class Levenshtein:
    """
    Class for computing Levenshtein distance and similarity ratio.
    
    This class provides static methods to calculate the edit distance between
    strings (how many insertions, deletions, or substitutions are needed to
    transform one string into another) and to determine a normalized similarity
    ratio between them.
    
    These metrics are widely used in fuzzy string matching, spell checking,
    and approximate text similarity measurements.
    """
```

The `Levenshtein` class offers methods to measure the difference between two strings and calculate their similarity.

          Calculate the similarity ratio based on distance and string length.
          
          This method normalizes the Levenshtein distance into a similarity ratio
          between 0 and 1, where 1 represents identical strings and 0 represents
          completely different strings.
          
          Args:
              distance (float): The Levenshtein distance between two strings.
              str_length (int): The length of the longer string.

          Returns:
              float: The similarity ratio, where higher values indicate greater similarity.
                  The range is [0.0, 1.0] where 1.0 means identical strings.

          This is the main method for determining string similarity. It calculates
          the Levenshtein distance and then converts it to a ratio representing

## Usage Guide

### Distance Calculation

The Levenshtein distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another.

**Example:**
```python
from levenshtein import Levenshtein

# Calculate the edit distance between two strings
distance = Levenshtein.distance("kitten", "sitting")
print(f"Levenshtein distance: {distance}")  # Output: 3
```

### Similarity Ratio

The similarity ratio is a normalized measure between 0 and 1, where 1 means the strings are identical and 0 means they are completely different.

**Example:**
```python
from levenshtein import Levenshtein

# Calculate the similarity ratio between two strings
similarity = Levenshtein.ratio("kitten", "sitting")
print(f"Similarity ratio: {similarity:.4f}")  # Output: 0.5714
```

## Algorithm Explanation

The Levenshtein distance algorithm uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum edit distance between two strings:

1. Initialize a matrix of size `(len(seq1)+1) × (len(seq2)+1)`
2. Fill the first row and column with increasing integers (0, 1, 2, ...)
3. For each cell in the matrix:
   - If the corresponding characters match, the cost is 0; otherwise, it's 1
   - Calculate the minimum cost from three possible operations:
     - Deletion: Value from the cell above + 1
     - Insertion: Value from the cell to the left + 1
     - Substitution: Value from the diagonal cell + cost
4. The bottom-right cell contains the final Levenshtein distance

## Complete Usage Example

```python
import numpy as np
from levenshtein import Levenshtein

# Test strings
string1 = "natural language processing"
string2 = "neural language processing"

# Calculate distance and similarity
distance = Levenshtein.distance(string1, string2)
similarity = Levenshtein.ratio(string1, string2)

print(f"Strings:\n1: '{string1}'\n2: '{string2}'")
print(f"Levenshtein distance: {distance}")
print(f"Similarity ratio: {similarity:.4f}")

# Example output:
# Strings:
# 1: 'natural language processing'
# 2: 'neural language processing'
# Levenshtein distance: 3
# Similarity ratio: 0.8889
```

## Performance Considerations

- Time Complexity: O(m×n) where m and n are the lengths of the input strings
- Space Complexity: O(m×n) due to the matrix storage
- For very long strings, consider using optimized variants or approximate algorithms

## Dependencies

The `Levenshtein` class relies on:

- `numpy`: For efficient matrix operations


## Applications

Levenshtein distance is commonly used in:

- Spell checking and correction
- DNA sequence alignment
- Plagiarism detection
- Fuzzy string matching
- Natural language processing
- Record linkage and data deduplication
